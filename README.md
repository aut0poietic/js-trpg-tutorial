#TRPG in JavaScript
###Using CreateJS

Companion source for my articles experimenting with building a browser-based Tactical RPG game in JavaScript
using CreateJS and any other library that occurs to me along the way.

A better ( or at least more extensive ) description can be found at the
[introduction page](http://irresponsibleart.com/2013/03/trpg-in-javascript-0/), but there are a few things you
should keep in mind while reviewing the source. For one, this is a learning experience for me. I've built very simple
games at the day job, but never anything using canvas extensively. Also, I'm a horrible artist, but building a game
means coming up with art. Mine sucks.

##How This Works

Each folder in the main repository corresponds to an article on my site, exploring what I did at each stage of
development. So "part-1" is the my first step on the game, containing all the mistake and missteps that went into it,
and has a corresponding [article](http://irresponsibleart.com/2013/03/trpg-in-javascript-2/) describing what I did and
where I believe things are going.

Admittedly, I could have used tags for this, but wanted to set this all up so that each 'part' folder updates the demo
code for the article it's associated with.

###You Want to Get Involved, huh?

As I said, this is a learning exercise for me. That said, I'll never turn down help or suggestions, if they're in the
form of issues, pull requests or whatever.

However, once a "part" is published, it's locked. I want that state saved for all posterity. Yes, they'll contain
mistakes. That's okay. Maybe someone will learn from them. Yanno, like me.

####Art
My art skills, both 2D and 3D, are rudimentary -- Normally when I work on a project like this we have an artist
and I only have to make sure that the art is built correctly. Not so here.

So, if you're a kick-ass 3D artist with time on your hands, I'd likely name children after you if you feel like
donating some character models or landscapes.

##Thanks
Seriously, thanks all of ya's that have encouraged me in this little experiment, whether talking at meets, linking on
Reddit or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aut0poietic), or just offering words of encouragement. You're awesome.
